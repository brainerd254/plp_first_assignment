Agile is an iterative and incremental process with overlapping phases.

Flexibility:
Waterfall: Inflexible; adjustments are difficult and expensive after a phase is done.
Agile: Extremely adaptable; can easily handle changes throughout the development process.

Customer involvement:
Waterfall is limited to the initial requirements phase and final delivery.
Agile: Continuous involvement and regular input throughout the project.

Documentation:
Waterfall: Extensive initial documentation.
Agile requires minimal documentation and focuses on working software.

Risk Management:
Waterfall approach: Risks are identified and planned for early in the project.
Agile involves continuous risk management with each iteration.

Delivery:
Waterfall: When the product is completed, it is distributed in its entirety.
Agile development involves delivering incremental builds throughout the project.


5.	What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
The methodical and disciplined process of identifying, recording, and overseeing a software system's needs is known as requirements engineering, or RE. It is an essential step in the software development process that guarantees the finished product satisfies stakeholders' requirements and expectations. 

The Process

Elicitation: Obtaining requirements from stakeholders through a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, workshops, observations, and document analysis.

Analysis and negotiation: involve understanding and prioritizing requirements, resolving conflicts between the needs of many stakeholders, and negotiating trade-offs to establish an agreement.

Specification: entails documenting the requirements in a clear, succinct, and unambiguous manner. This may entail generating formal documentation, user stories, use cases, and models.

Validation: entails ensuring that the written requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and are feasible to implement within the given restrictions. This could include reviews, prototyping, and simulations.

Management: entails maintaining and controlling requirements throughout the project's lifecycle. This includes keeping track of modifications, guaranteeing traceability, and coordinating stakeholder communication about needs.

Importance

Enhances Quality: Having precise and well-defined criteria makes it easier to create systems that satisfy user needs and lower the likelihood of errors.
Cost and Time Efficiency: By identifying requirements early on, fewer expensive and time-consuming changes are required later on in the development process.
Stakeholder Satisfaction: Achieving corporate objectives and meeting stakeholder needs is made possible by well-managed requirements.
Risk Mitigation: Proactive actions can be done by identifying potential risks and problems early in the process through understanding and addressing requirements.


6.	Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Modularity is a fundamental idea in software architecture that includes breaking down a software system into discrete, independent components or modules, each of which encapsulates a single functionality or a collection of related functionalities. 

Isolation of Changes: Low coupling means changes in one module are less likely to affect others. 
Simplified Debugging and Testing: Independent module testing simplifies bug identification and resolution.
Smaller, well-defined modules improve readability and understandability compared to monolithic codebases. 
Clearer documentation: Modular systems typically have organized and focused documentation. 
Reusable Components: Well-designed modules can be reused in multiple projects or parts of the same project. 






7.	Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Testing Units
Verifying an application's smallest testable components, or units, which are usually single functions or methods, is the main goal of unit testing. This stage of testing, which is often carried out by developers in the development stage, tries to guarantee that every unit functions as planned when used independently. 
Integration Testing 
Integration testing checks that integrated units or modules interact correctly and function as a unit. Developers or a dedicated integration testing team can handle this level of testing. System Testing
System testing entails verifying that the entire, fully integrated software system operates in accordance with the given specifications. 
Assessment of Acceptance
The last stage of testing before software is shipped to customers or put on the market is called acceptance testing.

8.	What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) are tools for managing changes to source code over time. They maintain track of all code changes in a unique form of database.

Importance in Software Development
Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. 
History and Audit: Every change made to the code is recorded with a timestamp, the author's name, and a message describing the change. 
Backup: By using a remote repository, VCS ensures that there is always a backup of the codebase. 
Code Review: Many VCS tools integrate with platforms that facilitate code review processes.
Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. 

Version Control System Examples

The most popular DVCS is called Git. Recognized for its effectiveness, adaptability, and robust backing of branching and merging.
Subversion (SVN): a well-liked CVCS that has gained popularity due to its uncomplicated version control methodology.
Mercurial is another DVCS that is well-known for its performance and user-friendliness, much like Git.


9.	Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is responsible for organizing the many parts required to get a project from inception to completion.
